## Stability Aware Policy Learning via Krasovskii's Approach with Application to Voltage Control

We provide our new experiment results in this webpage.

### OpenAI Pendulum Swingup task

#### Performance comparison of the learned policies

Table 1: Performance of different learnt policies on 200 different test episodes with different initial angle and angular velocity.
| Method                          |Cost Mean              |Cost Standard deviation |
| ------------------------------- |-----------------------|------------------------|
| DDPG                            | -137.52               |  82.50                 |
| Stable-DDPG                     | -128.56               |  76.30                 |
| Jointly learning method [ref 16]| -370.37               |  279.37                |
